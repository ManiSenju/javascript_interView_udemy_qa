/*
Design a form with three independent components
Dropdown Component - [{label:’GET’,value=’get’},{label:’POST’,value=’post’}]
Input component - [ URL - String ]
Button Component - onSubmit()

User will select one of the options in the dropdown and enter the URL in the input box, if both values are valid then enable the submit button.
